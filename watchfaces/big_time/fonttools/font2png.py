#
# Used to create image tiles suitable for use by the "Big Watch" watch
# face.
#
# The meta data for the images produced is output to the terminal for
# copy pasta into `resource_map.json`.
#
#
# This script should be run from the root of the watch project
# directory, like this:
#
#    python fonttools/font2png.py
#
# On Mac OS X you can use it like this to have the meta data copied
# directly to the clipboard, ready for pasting:
#
#     python fonttools/font2png.py | pbcopy
#
#
# These image tiles are needed because Pebble can't handle the 100
# point font size required by the watch. Each image tile is a quarter
# of the display.
#
# The generation of tiles is more complicated than it needs to be due to:
#
#   a) For Nevis (at least) the digits seem to return a fixed height
#      of 115 pixels even though the digits don't take up that much
#      vertical space. This means we can't use `getsize()` for
#      dimensions.
#
#   b) The bottom of the digits seem to get clipped (by PIL) unless
#      the canvas has a bunch of extra space. (This may be related to
#      <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1933766/fonts-clipping-with-pil>
#      or
#      <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13821882/pil-cut-off-letters/13831117#13831117>.)
#
# Because of these complications, we have to center the digit
# manually.
#
# We first plot the digit on a large canvas, then crop to just the
# bounds of the character and then paste the result centered on a
# canvas of the correct size.
