/*

   Demonstrate how to display an image with black, white and transparent sections.

   To achieve this effect you need to use a `RotBmpPairContainer` which contains
   two bitmaps: one is black and transparent, the other is white and transparent.

   The two bitmaps are created during the build process from a RGBA format PNG file.

   The image can also be rotated at runtime.

   The demonstration image is a modified version of the following SVG
   exported from Inkscape:
